          <p>“What differentiates the ALX <br>Software Engineering programme <br> from any programme I have taken <br>or heard of is its unique non- <br>traditional approach to learning. I<br> can testify that within 3 months I<br> learnt more than I did in one full <br> year of my university with the <br> traditional education model. The <br> programme is very intense, but the <br> time commitment is worth it. This is <br> the best decision that I have made. I <br> would honestly recommend this to <br> any serious student who wants to <br> learn and understand every <br> concept in software engineering <br> deeply."</p>

          <p>“I've enrolled in other training <br>programmes in the past, but ALX's <br> Software Engineering course was <br>exceptional because it gave me the <br>opportunity to work on real projects. <br> It was intense and thorough, and I <br> am happy to have completed it. <br> Aside from core programming skills, <br> ALX taught us patience, resilience, <br> and a lot of other industry practices <br> that I am benefitting from now.”</p>

          <p>“ALX enhanced my software <br>engineering skills by providing <br>structure around learning software <br> development methods and <br> providing ample practice to <br> thoroughly absorb and apply the <br>modules. Anyone can apply to the <br>Software Engineering programme. <br> 70 hours a week may seem like a lot,<br> but while you're doing the projects,<br> time flies by. If you're someone who <br> likes solving problems, then this is a <br> fun programme to be in. I highly <br> recommend it!”</p>
